- 👋 Hi, I’m @Gianeh, I'm an undergraduate student at the engineering department of Siena, Italy.
 
- 👀 I’m kind of a nerd in general but particularly I love computer science and in the last years i developed a passion for engineering in general and pure math too.
      other of my interests are: weightlifting and fitness, Science fiction (Philip K. Dick, Gibson, Stanisław Lem, Asimov) and Fantasy (mainly Tolkien) books, but
      I love reading in general (from essay to romance) and, last but not least at all, SCIENCE.

- 🌱 University takes a lot of effort but I spend a great part of my free time learning about coding and programming languages such as C, C++, python and javascript,
      though probably I'm mostly passionate about Science and it's communication in general. recently I'm working on some retro games, cellular automaton and small neural 
      networks with the SFML library for C++ that I'm learning by my self. I'm not an expert by any stretch of immagination at any of the previous but I'm aiming to 
      master some. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small games in C++ and/or in JS (also wrote something in p5.js), but mostly I aim to build a network of people that share some common
     interests and some divergent knowledge.

- 📫 You can reach me at pietropianigiani2@gmail.com for clarifications on my small code contibutions and also to share passions and nerdy stuff.
